> In this pale blue dot, our planet, earth - the little kingdom, **hardy forerunners** are needed to **tip the scales** in favour of the **Cosmic Divine**.

> "Where there is joy in the heart and the person is in intimate **touch with the cosmos**, there poetry reigns! When it's brimming from the soul, there in **every motion, every thought**, then humankind will lead **The Life Divine** - such is the power of **The Future Poetry**" ~ _Imran Ali Namazi, c. 2021_

> "If only we learn to let go of our cares and niggles, even if only for a moment, there we find bliss and thus enraptured, we are lead to 'spontaneous creation and expression'. Some call this flow state, some call this Samadi - I call this poetry" - Imran Ali Namazi

> I would Imagine a world, beautiful, just, perfect. And know that GOD (the DEVAS) sees it much clearer than we. So I trust, honing my skills that one day, my writing and my inspiration will be of some use.

* We are all a bunch of loving, lovable souls who have somehow forgotten that.
* We are analogue spiritual beings, donning the cloak of ignorance for the delight of simply setting each other free.
* In this pale blue dot, our planet, earth - the little kingdom, hardy forerunners are needed to tip the scales in favour of the Cosmic Divine.
* Recognize the cycles&hellip; of ebbs and flows.. sadnesses and joys&hellip; heroism and muddledness, embrace the moment fully.
* Break the cycle of stubborn dreams, utilize every moment to advance with vigil and virility.
* Forsake your brother or Mother Nature at your peril. But know that in the END, we shall all stand together, having merged with the Source.
* Be at peace blessed one&hellip; we are all children of the same universe.

* Personal Wishes? To have enthusiasm and spread positivity.
* Outcome? That we can all can find the gifts each problem brings and pave the way, slowly, irrefutably, towards a Life Divine.
* Obstacle? The dolt-headedness in each of us and stubbornness to wait for someone to turn the light on when&hellip; if it's dark, we may BECOME the light.
* Plan? For me atleast, one smile, one gesture, one crafted word or idea at a time!
