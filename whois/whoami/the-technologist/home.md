## Career Post 2016

* At Headstream, I learnt my first reactive framework namely Durandal, wrote my first javascript classes which avoided all the boilerplate code in the MVVM architecture we had, transitioned the main pages to a new design, reviewed both product team's code and wrote a robust and generic reporting framework.
* In between HST and Sulekha I spent some time learning the basics of 3d viz aframe.io and used the rudiments of Google Cloud for some of its features. I also developed my own file based cms called amadeusweb.com. See all its sites at [code.amadeusweb.com](https://code.amadeusweb.com/).
* At Sulekha, I started and led the VueJS 3.0 practice, quickly learning Capacitor to make us mobile and hybrid and wrote several layers of cross product framework code.


Other significant contributions in each of these roles [you can see here](./past-life/BTNINFO).

## In Closing

I was a hobbyist electronics and vb6 programmer through school and college and did about 5 projects in my final year alone. We learnt vb6 back in the days before Google and before .Net just pouring our wits into the Integrated Development Environment.

On a personal note, I'm an optimist, creative writer, poet and at 40, am just bubbling with ideas for the workplace and the extended work and societal families.
