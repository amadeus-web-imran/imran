### Ad displaying product

Worked in php in a 3 man team augmenting the MON team in Bellevue at blinkx.com after a visit there. It was being migrated from .Net.

Ported select features to Kohana / Laravel and YiiFramework, developing a statistics module in each for benchmarking so we could choose what suited us best.

Was a key player as the only developer to know both languages so would help the existing team pickup php.

Also had a taste of AWS
